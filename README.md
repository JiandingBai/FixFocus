## Features

FocusFlow is a Chrome extension designed to help students and individuals with ADHD stay engaged while learning. By tracking eye movements, it ensures that your attention remains on learning content by pausing videos whenever your gaze drifts away. Once your focus returns to the screen, the video resumes seamlessly.

Ideal for online classes, tutorials, or self-paced learning, FocusFlow minimizes distractions and helps users maintain their flow state, making every study session more productive and focused.
